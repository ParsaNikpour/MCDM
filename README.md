# MCDM Techniques in Python
This repository contains Python implementations of multi-criteria decision-making techniques.

:triangular_flag_on_post: I have added Pairwise Comparison Matrix, Best-Worst Method and AHP to the code. 

:triangular_flag_on_post:From compensatory techniques, only Entropy, SAW, and WASPAS have been implemented.

:triangular_flag_on_post:The non-compensatory techniques are completed so far, which include Dominance, Maximin, Maximax, Hurwicz, Conjunctive, Disjunctive, Lexicographic, SemiLexicographic and Permutation methods.


# PCM
In this method, a matrix is used (like figure.1) to compute the weights of each criteria.
