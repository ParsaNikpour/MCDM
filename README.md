# MCDM Techniques in Python
This repository contains Python :snake: implementations of multi-criteria decision-making techniques.

:triangular_flag_on_post: I have added Pairwise Comparison Matrix, Best-Worst Method, and AHP to the code :grey_exclamation:

:triangular_flag_on_post:From compensatory techniques, only Entropy, SAW, and WASPAS have been implemented :grey_exclamation:

:triangular_flag_on_post:The non-compensatory :thumbsdown::thumbsup: techniques are completed so far, which include Dominance, Maximin, Maximax, Hurwicz, Conjunctive, Disjunctive, Lexicographic, SemiLexicographic and Permutation methods :grey_exclamation:


## ðŸ§ :PCM
In this method, a matrix is used (like Figure.1) to compute the weights of each criteria.

ðŸŒµBefore computing the weights, the consistency of the matrix should be checked. If the matrix is consistent there are four methods to find the weights: 

  1. Sum of Rows 
  2. Sum of Columns
  3. Arithmetic Mean 
  4. Geometric Mean

ðŸ¥‘Geometric Mean is the best, and the Sum of Rows is the worst one. However, if the matrix is inconsistant, there are four methods to compute the weights:
  1. Least Square Method
  2. Logarithmic Least Square Method
  3. Eigenvalue Method
 
  
## Best-Worst Method (BWM)
You can find this method in [2]. This method reduces the computations a lot; however, it requires solving a nonlinear mathematical model. 
The baseline code is from https://github.com/Valdecy/pyDecision.git repository. However, there were some issues ðŸ“°, which I corrected.

There are two methods for computing consistency in BWM: 
1. Input-based consistency
2. Output-based consistency

Both of which have been added to the code.

Also, there are two models to find the weights. You can find both of them in the code.


## AHP
I used https://github.com/PhilipGriffith/AHPy.git repo for this method. Amazing implementation, but it does not support qualitative values :x:

You can find an example of AHP in Figure.2.
